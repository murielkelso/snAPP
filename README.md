# snAPP
Creating my first web/mobile application, snAPP. 
It's purpose is to facilitate weight machine workouts at a gym by keeping track of details such as which machine, seat setting, amount of weight, number of reps, ect. 
My intent is to implement this app twice for practice: once with AndroidStudio (Java, Junit, etc) and once with MeteorJS (Javascrip, Mongo, etc).

UPDATE: I would like to comment that this app is very new, and is mainly for me to explore these new technologies. The meteor portion is still just in the tutorial phase, and the Android portion is in the early stages of development.
