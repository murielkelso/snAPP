# snAPP
Creating my first web/mobile application, snAPP. It's purpose is to facilitate weight machine workouts at a gym by keeping track of details such as which machine, seat setting, amount of weight, number of reps, ect. My intent is to implement this app twice for practice: once with AndroidStudio (Java, Junit, etc) and once with MeteorJS (Javascrip, Mongo, etc).
